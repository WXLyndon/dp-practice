# There are n houses built in a line. A thief wants to steal the maximum possible money from
# these houses. The only restriction the thief has is that he canâ€™t steal from two consecutive
# houses, as that would alert the security system. How should the thief maximize his stealing?
# Given a number array representing the wealth of n houses, determine the maximum amount of
# money the thief can steal without alerting the security system.

# EX1: Input: {2, 5, 1, 3, 6, 2, 4}
#      Output: 15
#      Explanation: The thief should steal from houses 5 + 6 + 4

# EX2: Input: {2, 10, 14, 8, 1}
#      Output: 18
#      Explanation: The thief should steal from houses 10 + 8
